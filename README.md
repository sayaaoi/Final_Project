# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)
One day in summer of Chicago, the owners of a mom&pop shop want to know what's the average waiting time for a customer to complete an order.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

Ice-cream: Number of ice-cream for each type ordered by customers (uniform distribution + normal discrete distribution)
Customer: Ordering time (normal distribution)
Customer: Thinking time (uniform distribution)
Customer: Number of customers comes to the shop in different time during a day (normal distribution)
Employee: Preparation time based on various levels of experience (normal distribution)


## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
NULL Hypothesis: Total waiting time has no association with the experience of employees or the number of ice-cream customers buy


## Analytical Summary of your findings:
(e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
Run icshop_simulation.py
